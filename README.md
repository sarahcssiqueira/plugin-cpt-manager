WordPress Core provides five post types by default: Post, Page, Attachment, Revision and Menu. Although, while working on a project, we may need to create our specific content types, and that can be easily done with a few lines of code. That is the purpose of the main Class in this plugin, using the [**register_post_type()**](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/) function.
